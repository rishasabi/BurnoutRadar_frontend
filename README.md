### The Problem Statement
Many students and professionals experience burnout but fail to recognize early warning signs. Lack of self-awareness and continuous monitoring leads to stress accumulation, reduced productivity, and mental exhaustion.

The real issue? People don't realize they're burning out until it's too late.
